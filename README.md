# Fullstack GraphQL Workshop

Welcome to the client portion of the workshop! For the morning session, we will be building a React app that pulls a list of movies, filters them by type, and allows you to favorite them after you've been logged in. The app is backed by Create React App and Apollo Client.

## File Structure (in order of importance):

- `index.js`: Where we set up Apollo Client
- `components/`: All of the React components that you will connect to Apollo
- `data.js`: Seed data powering the components before we switch to GraphQL
- `App.js`: The top-level App component. You won't need to modify this file.
- `index.css`: Some random CSS. You won't need to modify this file.

## Running on CodeSandbox
